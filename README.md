The website that we have made is an interactive travel map called Tour the World. It is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The website features an interactive map that allows the user to select a location to travel to. Each location transports them to a page that shows them everything about the city. It shows them maps of the top tourists locations and information on them. 

When hovering over the countries, the users can get an overview of the country. After clicking on the overview, they then see the above page open in a separate browser.
